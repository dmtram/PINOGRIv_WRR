Parameter Inversion Optimised for Groundwater Issues (PINOGRI)
** Written by Dimitri Rambourg, ITES (CNRS-University of Strasbourg)

PINOGRI is a calibration tool for 2D hydrogeological model, using Pilot points, with two main options :
(1) estimation of transmissivity and storativity (#HYDRO)
(2) joint estimation of hydrodynamic and lithological parameters (#LITHO]
