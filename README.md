Parameter Inversion Optimised for Groundwater Issues (PINOGRI)
** Written by Dimitri Rambourg, ITES (CNRS-University of Strasbourg)

PINOGRI is a calibration tool for 2D hydrogeological model, using Pilot points, with two main options :
(1) estimation of transmissivity and storativity (#HYDRO)
(2) joint estimation of hydrodynamic and lithological parameters (#LITHO]

THe code source is the one used to compute the result of the article "CONSTRAINING 2D HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVERSION WITH 3D LITHOLOGICAL DATA".
The input data covers the 4 synthetic cases described in the article (HYDRO/LITHO for the option - DENSE/SPARSE for the samplings) and the direct simulation giving the "true" data used as constraint during the inversion.
